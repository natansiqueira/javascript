# JavaScript

A repository to keep track of everything I've learned about the ECMAScript language specification.

The content of the course ["JavaScript Masterclass"](https://app.branas.io/public/products/c09d58ff-ce6b-491b-b158-9982583dff79) will be the foundation for this repository since it covers almost the entire ECMAScript specification. The idea is to build step by step a [DBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) with support to SQL language and its main commands create table, insert, select, update and delete using the ECMAScript.
