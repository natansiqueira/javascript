# Data types overview

* In JavaScript like in other programming languages there is primitives and objects data types.
* Primitives are immutable
* There are 6 primitives data types
    * Number
    * String
    * Boolean
    * Symbol
    * null
    * undefined
* There is an operator typeof to print the data type of some value
* You can use the node REPL (Read, Eval, Print and Loop) to check this data types
* The data types have a wrapper (a.k.a Boxing) to allow us to use the prototype methods of the data type
* Objects are references in memory
