# History of ECMAScript

* In 1989, Tim Berners Lee created the World Wide Web (Not the internet)
* Also created the 3 main parts which are Server, Protocol and Browser
* At the beginning the Web was used to exchange scientific work because the Browsers were text based
* With the creation of Browsers with GUI the Web became a "general purpose" tool allowing us to use images, audio, etc
* One of the biggest navigators at that time was Nestcape Navigator created by Marc Andressen
* Hypercard an Apple Browser introduced an embedded scripting language called Hypertalk
* Marc Andressen wanted to create a similar language for its Browser Netscape Navigator. Brendan Eich was invited to work on this project
* Brendan Eich suggested the use of a Scheme based language but it wasn't friendly as the Hypertalk. They needed something more popular and easy to use and Java was one of the popular languages at the time and it was chosen as an inpiration for the programming language Brendan Eich was aiming to build. Also Scheme, Self and Perl influenced its language.
* The first name for the new programming language was Mocha. Since Mocha was a common name the language got a new name LiveScript to match other tools from Netscape like LiveMail.
* With the Browser War (Microsoft vs Nestcape) the name was changed as part of a deal between to Sun and Netscape to JavaScript to keep an exclusive language for the Netscape Browser and use "Java" wich was super popular at the time to improve the adoption of the programming language
* Microsoft brought JScript to fight back that deal
* Nestcape tried to create a standard with W3C for the JavaScript but at the end ECMA International standardized the language and changing the name JavaScript to ECMAScript (Official name)
